Once the preferred dose is selected for Stage 2, subjects from Stage 1 will be treated as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   Selected dose: After the interim analysis, subjects will remain in the study, blinded on the selected dose until\\r\\n    the last Stage 2 subject finishes 12 months exposure.\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   Placebo: After the interim analysis, subjects will remain in the study, blinded on placebo until the last Stage 2\\r\\n    subject finishes 12 months exposure.\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   Non-selected doses: After the interim analysis, subjects will be switched to the blinded selected dose until the\\r\\n    last Stage 2 subject finishes 12 months exposure.\\r\\nAll subjects in Stage 2 will remain in the study, blinded (on placebo or selected dose) until the last Stage 2 subject\\r\\nfinishes 12 months of exposure.\\r\\nAll subjects who stop blinded treatment during the blinded extension period (after completion of Stage 1 or 2) will\\r\\nbe given the opportunity to enroll in an open-label long-term safety extension study.\\r\\nStage 1: Characterize Dose Response Relationship\\r\\nSubjects will attend the study site for a Screening / Consent Visit (Visit 1, Day -35), when their consent will be\\r\\nobtained and general eligibility to participate in the study will be checked including drawing blood to check their\\r\\nclinical laboratory values. Subjects will discontinue all excluded gastroparesis (GP) medication and return\\r\\napproximately 2 weeks later to recheck their clinical laboratory values and perform a 4-hour 13C-Spirulina Gastric\\r\\nEmptying Breath Test (GEBT) (Visit 2, Day -21). An 8 hour fast is required prior to the GEBT. Subjects will then\\r\\nreturn within 7 days after the GEBT visit to confirm their eligibility (Visit 3, Day -14). Once eligibility is confirmed\\r\\nat this visit, subjects will be given an electronic patient reported outcomes (PRO) tool for collecting GP symptom\\r\\ndata and be shown how to use it. This will be the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society\\r\\nGastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index-Daily Diary (ANMS GCSI-DD). Subjects will record their symptoms once\\r\\ndaily (in the evening) and will return to the clinic approximately 2 weeks later to assess their GP symptom eligibility\\r\\nbased on the ANMS GCSI-DD (Visit 4, Randomization). Subjects must be compliant with completing the ANMS\\r\\nGCSI-DD, defined as â\\x89Ľ 80% diary completions, during the 2-week symptom assessment period.\\r\\nSubjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into 1 of 4 treatment groups: TAK-906 5, 25, and 50 mg tablet BID or matching\\r\\nplacebo BID in the morning (approximately 1 hour before the first meal of the day) and evening (approximately 1\\r\\nhour before dinner and 12 hours after the morning dose) and stratified by IG and DG (minimum 30 subjects per\\r\\nindication per arm). Subjects will take their first dose of study medication at the randomization visit. Subjects will\\r\\ncomplete the ANMS GCSI-DD daily for 12 weeks and attend the clinic at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 and have additional\\r\\n                                                  CONFIDENTIAL\\r\\n\\x0cTAK-906\\r\\nStudy No. TAK-906-2002                                                                                    Page 2 of 16\\r\\nClinical Protocol Study Synopsis                                                                          18 July 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nGEBTs performed after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment.\\r\\nDoses for Stage 1 were chosen based on the data in healthy subjects from the phase 1 Study AT-01C. The TAK-906\\r\\n5 mg BID, 25 mg BID and 50 mg BID doses are expected to maximize efficacy and minimize potential long term\\r\\nsafety and tolerability concerns. Several considerations were given to dose selection: safety, tolerability, PK, and PD\\r\\n(prolactin). Prolactin has been used as a measure of target engagement. Using an Emax model to characterize the\\r\\nplasma TAK-906-prolactin concentration relationship, the maximum dose selected (50 mg BID) is predicted to be\\r\\nassociated with nearly maximum prolactin production at steady state. Furthermore, no clinically meaningful effects\\r\\non QT and cardiac repolarization are expected on the highest dose. This dose was also shown to be safe and well\\r\\ntolerated for up to 4 days in the multiple ascending dose portion of Study AT-01C. The half maximal effective\\r\\nconcentration (EC50) estimate for TAK-906-prolactin concentration relationship is estimated to be approximately 5\\r\\nmg BID; therefore this dose is considered a minimally effective dose. The 25 mg BID dose was selected it is\\r\\nexpected to be a therapeutically safe and efficacious dose.\\r\\nAn interim analysis will be conducted after approximately 280 subjects have completed or withdrawn from the first\\r\\npart of the 12 weeks study (Stage 1). Based on the interim analysis, the dose, response definition, and study\\r\\nendpoints for phase 3 (Stage 2) will be selected. All patients completing Stage 1 (12 weeks dose response) will\\r\\ncontinue on their original randomized, double-blind (R/DB) dose until the preferred dose is selected for Stage 2.\\r\\nOnce the preferred dose is selected for Stage 2, patients from Stage 1 will be treated as follows:\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   Selected dose: After the interim analysis, subjects will remain in the study, blinded on the selected dose until\\r\\n    the last Stage 2 subject finishes 12 months exposure.\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   Placebo: After the interim analysis, subjects will remain in the study, blinded on placebo until the last Stage 2\\r\\n    subject finishes 12 months exposure.\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   Non-selected doses: After the interim analysis, subjects will be switched to the blinded selected dose until the\\r\\n    last Stage 2 subject finishes 12 months of exposure.\\r\\nAfter completion of Stage 1 (12 weeks dose response), subjects will attend the clinic after 4 weeks, 8 weeks and\\r\\nthen every 12 weeks and will complete the ANMS GCSI-DD for the 7 days before each visit. Subjects who\\r\\nwithdraw prematurely will be seen for an early termination visit as soon as possible where they will complete the\\r\\nANMS GCSI-DD with 7-day recall at this termination visit and will then be contacted for a follow-up 30 days after\\r\\nthe last dose of study medication.\\r\\nAdjustments to subject selection criteria and endpoints may be made for Stage 2 following the interim analysis.\\r\\nAll subjects who stop blinded treatment during the blinded extension period (after completion of Stage 1) will be\\r\\ngiven the opportunity to enroll in an open label long term safety extension study.\\r\\nStage 2: Efficacy and 12-Month safety\\r\\nAfter the dose selection decision based on Stage 1, approximately 600 new subjects will be randomized in a 2:1\\r\\nratio (active:placebo) and stratified by IG and DG (minimum 40% per indication in each arm) to receive the selected\\r\\nTAK-906 dose or placebo for 12 weeks.\\r\\nSubjects will attend the study site for a Screening / Consent Visit (Visit 1, Day -35), when their consent will be\\r\\nobtained and general eligibility to participate in the study will be checked, including drawing blood to check their\\r\\nclinical laboratory values.

The DMC will be responsible for maintaining the integrity of the study. It is for this purpose\\r\\nthat the DMC will review interim efficacy and safety data and will be empowered to implement the adaptive\\r\\nchanges specified in the protocol. The DMC will perform these duties in addition to the customary duties of\\r\\nsafeguarding the interest of study participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of the interventions during the study,\\r\\nand for monitoring the overall conduct of the clinical study. The DMC will provide recommendations about\\r\\nstopping or continuing the study. In order to enhance the integrity of the study, the DMC may also formulate\\r\\nrecommendations relating to the selection/recruitment/retention of participants, management of the study\\r\\nparticipants, improving adherence to protocol-specific regimens, and the procedures for data management and\\r\\nquality control.\\r\\nThe DMC for this study differs from the usual DMC in 2 important ways:\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   The DMC will make recommendation as to whether the study should be modified based on the interim analysis\\r\\n    results, and what changes should be made. Primarily, the changes will be related to dose selection, primary\\r\\n    endpoint selection, sample size modification, or study termination. In most cases a DMC will only advise\\r\\n    termination of a study based on safety concerns or overwhelming efficacy.\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   The DMC will have primary responsibility for assessing the efficacy of each dose versus placebo at the interim\\r\\n    analysis but the committee will also take into account the safety of the dose groups which are effective when it\\r\\n    recommends sample sizes for the second stage of the study.\\r\\nStatistical Considerations:\\r\\nThe full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug,\\r\\nand have at least 1 postbaseline value for assessment of efficacy. In FAS efficacy summaries, subjects will be\\r\\nanalyzed by the treatment to which they were randomized.\\r\\nThe Safety Set will include all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of double-blind study\\r\\nmedication. In safety summaries, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. In the event\\r\\nthat a subject receives more than 1 treatment, the actual treatment will be defined as the one that is used most\\r\\nfrequently. If the 2 most common treatments are used with equal frequency, then the randomized treatment will be\\r\\nused as the actual treatment.\\r\\nPrimary variable is the change from Baseline in GCSI-DD composite. Analysis will be based on a mixed model for\\r\\nrepeated measurements (MMRM) analysis of covariance with treatment, center, week, treatment-by-week\\r\\ninteraction, and baseline score-by-week interaction as fixed effects, with a completely unstructured covariance\\r\\nmatrix. Comparisons between the different doses of TAK-906 and placebo will be performed for all assessment time\\r\\npoints. Based on a Missing at Random Assumption, this analysis will be performed using observed case (OC) data\\r\\nonly.\\r\\nThe proportion of responders will be analyzed at all time points by logistic regression adjusting for Baseline score\\r\\nand treatment by both LOCF and OC methods.\\r\\nTo control the overall type I error at 0.05 for the tests comparing TAK-906 doses versus placebo in the primary\\r\\nendpoint, the inverse normal p-value combination test together with the closed testing procedure will be used to\\r\\nadjust for multiple comparisons and sample size re-estimation. For the combination test, weights 1/5 and 4/5 will be\\r\\nused to combine the p-values before and after the interim analysis, i.e., 1/5 for Stage 1 and 4/5 for Stage 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  CONFIDENTIAL\\r\\n\\x0cTAK-906\\r\\nStudy No. TAK-906-2002                                                                                   Page 9 of 16\\r\\nClinical Protocol Study Synopsis                                                                         18 July 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nSample Size Justification:\\r\\nThis study will use a two-stage design with dose selection confirmed at IA.

It is assumed that the change from Baseline in ANMS-GCDI-DD\\r\\ntotal score is approximately normal with a common standard deviation of 1.25 and the drop-out rate at end of 12\\r\\nweeks study is 20%. By using an inverse normal combination test with weights 1/5 for Stage 1 and 4/5 for Stage 2,\\r\\nthis study has at least 90% power to detect a difference of 0.375 between the selected TAK-906 dose and placebo at\\r\\na 0.05 2-sided significance level.\\r\\nInterim Analysis: An interim analysis will be conducted for all subjects and also in both subgroups of diabetic and\\r\\nidiopathic gastroparesis subjects after approximately 280 subjects have completed or withdrawn from the first part\\r\\nof the 12 weeks study (Stage 1). Based on the efficacy and/or safety results from the interim analysis, the dose,\\r\\nresponse definition, and study endpoints for phase 3 (Stage 2) will be selected.

Several considerations were given to dose selection: safety, tolerability, PK, and PD\\r\\n(prolactin). Prolactin has been used as a measure of target engagement. Using an Emax model to characterize the\\r\\nplasma TAK--prolactin concentration relationship, the maximum dose selected ( mg BID) is predicted to be\\r\\nassociated with nearly maximum prolactin production at steady state. Furthermore, no clinically meaningful effects\\r\\non QT and cardiac repolarization are expected on the highest dose. This dose was also shown to be safe and well\\r\\ntolerated for up to  days in the multiple ascending dose portion of Study AT-C. The half maximal effective\\r\\nconcentration (EC) estimate for TAK--prolactin concentration relationship is estimated to be approximately \\r\\nmg BID; therefore this dose is considered a minimally effective dose.

The DMC will be responsible for maintaining the integrity of the study. It is for this purpose\\r\\nthat the DMC will review interim efficacy and safety data and will be empowered to implement the adaptive\\r\\nchanges specified in the protocol. The DMC will perform these duties in addition to the customary duties of\\r\\nsafeguarding the interest of study participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of the interventions during the study,\\r\\nand for monitoring the overall conduct of the clinical study. The DMC will provide recommendations about\\r\\nstopping or continuing the study. In order to enhance the integrity of the study, the DMC may also formulate\\r\\nrecommendations relating to the selection/recruitment/retention of participants, management of the study\\r\\nparticipants, improving adherence to protocol-specific regimens, and the procedures for data management and\\r\\nquality control.\\r\\nThe DMC for this study differs from the usual DMC in  important ways:\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   The DMC will make recommendation as to whether the study should be modified based on the interim analysis\\r\\n    results, and what changes should be made. Primarily, the changes will be related to dose selection, primary\\r\\n    endpoint selection, sample size modification, or study termination. In most cases a DMC will only advise\\r\\n    termination of a study based on safety concerns or overwhelming efficacy.\\r\\nď\\x82ˇ   The DMC will have primary responsibility for assessing the efficacy of each dose versus placebo at the interim\\r\\n    analysis but the committee will also take into account the safety of the dose groups which are effective when it\\r\\n    recommends sample sizes for the second stage of the study.\\r\\nStatistical Considerations:\\r\\nThe full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects who were randomized, received at least  dose of study drug,\\r\\nand have at least  postbaseline value for assessment of efficacy. In FAS efficacy summaries, subjects will be\\r\\nanalyzed by the treatment to which they were randomized.\\r\\nThe Safety Set will include all subjects who were randomized and received at least  dose of double-blind study\\r\\nmedication. In safety summaries, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. In the event\\r\\nthat a subject receives more than  treatment, the actual treatment will be defined as the one that is used most\\r\\nfrequently. If the  most common treatments are used with equal frequency, then the randomized treatment will be\\r\\nused as the actual treatment.\\r\\nPrimary variable is the change from Baseline in GCSI-DD composite. Analysis will be based on a mixed model for\\r\\nrepeated measurements (MMRM) analysis of covariance with treatment, center, week, treatment-by-week\\r\\ninteraction, and baseline score-by-week interaction as fixed effects, with a completely unstructured covariance\\r\\nmatrix. Comparisons between the different doses of TAK- and placebo will be performed for all assessment time\\r\\npoints. Based on a Missing at Random Assumption, this analysis will be performed using observed case (OC) data\\r\\nonly.\\r\\nThe proportion of responders will be analyzed at all time points by logistic regression adjusting for Baseline score\\r\\nand treatment by both LOCF and OC methods.\\r\\nTo control the overall type I error at . for the tests comparing TAK- doses versus placebo in the primary\\r\\nendpoint, the inverse normal p-value combination test together with the closed testing procedure will be used to\\r\\nadjust for multiple comparisons and sample size re-estimation. For the combination test, weights / and / will be\\r\\nused to combine the p-values before and after the interim analysis, i.e., / for Stage  and / for Stage .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  CONFIDENTIAL\\r\\n\\x0cTAK-\\r\\nStudy No. TAK--                                                                                   Page  of \\r\\nClinical Protocol Study Synopsis                                                                          July \\r\\n\\r\\nSample Size Justification:\\r\\nThis study will use a two-stage design with dose selection confirmed at IA. It is planned to enroll approximately \\r\\nsubjects (with a ::: ratio for TAK- doses and placebo) for Stage  and approximately  subjects (with a\\r\\n: ratio for TAK- versus placebo) for Stage . It is assumed that the change from Baseline in ANMS-GCDI-DD\\r\\ntotal score is approximately normal with a common standard deviation of . and the drop-out rate at end of \\r\\nweeks study is %.
